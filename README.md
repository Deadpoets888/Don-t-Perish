## 🚀 Overview

Retailers often suffer significant losses due to unsold **perishable goods** like milk, bread, and fresh produce. Our Smart Inventory Manager:
- Tracks product expiry, stock, and sales velocity
- Detects high-risk items likely to expire before sale
- Suggests dynamic discounts to avoid losses
- Recommends reorder quantities for fast-selling products

📈 The result: reduced waste, smarter shelf rotation, and increased revenue.
